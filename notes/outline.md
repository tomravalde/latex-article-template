# Introduction

## Urban trends
- Increase
- Important
- Innevitable

## Challenges
- Environmental
- Economic
	- Bettencourt
- Both of the above reflected in policy environments
- Opportunities
	- Synergies, nexus

- @Agudelo-Vera2011
	- resource management is part of urban planning
	- recent years have seem problems take on a global dimension
	- list of impacts which cities have had on 'atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere and biospehere by extracting large quantities of natural resources
	- human society may no longer be supported. (A line for the intro?)
	- Relationship between resource management (handling resources to meet needs), urban planning (to achieve and objective, through a sequence of activities with various considerations)) and sustainable development (meeting our needs without compromising future generations needs)
	- History: Having been about meeting basic needs (e.g. roads for transport) UP became about minimising heath impacts in 19th C. 20th C, it's now about pollution and resource depletion. Urban forms have changed in response to changing needs. Garden cities, compact cities etc.
	- Now: 'end-of-pipe' solutions to prevent emissions, moving to other strategies, such as dematerialisation.
	- Multiple conflicting objectives in UP (quality of life vs. resource minimisation)
	- 'There is a need for a comprehensive framework that integrates RM and UP.' '...RM becomes a formal and critical link between UP and SD'.
	- Rees2009: 'Urban planning in the 21st Centuary should evolve towards an ecologically-oriented macro-architecture, fully integrating the design and location of of energy-and material-efficient buildings and urban infrastructure with overall spatial planning further to minimize material throughput'.
	- Authors working on 'urban harvest' approach for spatial planning.

- @Bettencourt2007
	- aims for a quantative understanding of 'human social organization and dynamics in cities'.
	- indicators are scaling f(city size) (Zipf's law)
	- as consumers and producers, cities find analogies with organisms, ecosystems etc.
	- organisms' physiological characteristics scale with mass.
		- shows economy of scale with energy requirements. Through self-similar nature of resource distribution networks which optimise themselves. 
	- Y(t) = Y0 * N(t)^{Beta}
	- The above law holds (e.g. for new patents, GDP, household water consumption etc.) confirming scaling laws in cities.
	- Value of Beta indicates sublinear---linear---superlinear
	- Superlinear relationships found in: new patentss, inventors, R&D employment, wages, GDP, bank deposits etc.
	- seemingly unrelated phenomena share very similar Beta values, suggesting an underlying universal social dynamic.
	- 2 observations
		1. systems that scale in resource consumption rates: rate decreases with increasing size.
		2. innovation driven processes: pace of life increases with increasing size of urban systems.
		- thus material economies of scale compete with innovation and wealth creation (driven by social interactions). E.g. total electricity consumption is superlinear, whilst cable lengths exhibit economies of scale. Thus the distribution network is necessarily sub-optimal (if demand is to be met).
		- so does efficiency or wealth creation determine urbanisation? How do they impact growth?
		- resource availability constrains growth.
		- urban growth eqn for N(t)		

	1. There are two possible underlying dynamics which drive urban growth
		a. Economies of scale B<1
		b. Innovation and wealth creation B>1
	2. When 1b is the case, cities will grow greater than exponentially.
	3. However, the singularity is never reached, because resources are utlimately finite.
	4. If the trend continues, then stagnation/collapse will occur.
	5. Unless a new innovation cycle arises to continue the growth of the city (new initial conditions and parameters required)
	6. The time between cycles must decrease (i.e. increasing rate of appearence of innovations to sustain the city).
- 1-6 are consistent with observations (e.g. New York)

- @Bhatt2010
	- urbanisation trends: 2/3 of population, yet 75% of GDP (in USA).
	- economic and environmental challenges confirmed
	- centres of innovation due to concentration of capital and population.
	- renewable energy industry can generate revenues and bring economic benefits.


# Urban metab
- Identify largest flows
- Measure
- Links to policy

- @Barles2010.
	- Analysis tools, findings/research for dematerialisation of societies.
	- linear/circular flows---linearisation cause of many problems inc. depletion, eutrophication.
	- Observe the tension between challenges/opportunities.
	- Observe the development of industrial ecology as a means to optimise the metabolism of the industrial sector.
		1. reduce material loss
		2. develop symbiosis.
	- history, growing populations etc.
	- Territorial ecology = urban ecology + industrial ecology.
	- 4 methods: MFA, SFA, EFA, EF. To understand urban biogeochemistry, and find methods for sustainability
	- conservation of matter. To 'understand, characterise or modify' UM.
	- Outline MFA, SFA, EFA, EF.
		- MFA: e.g. how much organic waste isn't recovered from food waste?
		- EFA: link between (traditional view of) metabolism (which has a more materials focus) and energy needs. References given for examples.
		- EF: to show impacts/delocalisation of consumption.

- @Barles2010
	- Eurostat method
	- Result that lots of food ends up as solid waste. This could be diverted to biogas.
	- (Existence of hidden flows in urban areas revealed by this study.) 
	- Multiscale approach reveals the large area Paris depends.
	- Shows how policies concerning waste management can reduce construction imports: identifies a target area for dematerialisation. E.g. by reducing demand (by opposing urban extension) and increasing recyling of construction materials. This is shown through the disparity whereby local extraction < regional consumption, and local extraction = landfill.

- @Ayers2000
	- assumes that vegetation is the only way to absorb CO2
	- assumes that fossil fuels are the only way to generate energy
	- neglects methane, sulphur and nitrogen
	- neglects emissions trading through self-sufficiency scenario.
	- OMits role of oceans in food production, carbon sinks etc. in pre-occupation with 'productive land'.
	- Therefore we can't immediately beleive that the EF of particular countries is 'too big'.
	- Doesn't tell us anything new: we already know the world is over-consuming or that no countries are 'autarkic'. Can't give us a meaningful rank ordering of countries.

- @BFF
	- WWE as highest flows
	- Qualify why we aren't considering the EF analysis as relevent.
- @Bettencourt2007
	- cities obey scaling relations as f(population)---self similarity
	- Consequences of population (rather than location etc.) on various urban metrics
	- innovation, wealth, crime etc. (per capita) flow down the heirarchy of cities (given by population size)
	- individuals and institutions need to adapt at continually accelarating rates to avoid stagnation or crises.
