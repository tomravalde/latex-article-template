Introductory sentences.

The subject of this thesis is an interesting topic of study. It requires both a broad understanding of the big picture of urban resource management in three areas (energy, water and waste), including knowledge of policy environments etc. coupled with an understanding of mathematical programming for optimsation models.

The final outcome of this study will be a suite of tools which can be used to optimise the provision of water, waste and energy resources within an urban area, at a minimal financial and environmental cost, subject to various constraints. Before the methodology and models are described, the context of the project is outliend in this introduction, to motivate their development. Firstly, global urban trends are summarised before outlining the challenges and opportunities that come with urban areas. The concept of `urban metabolism' is introduced, which will provide the underlying theoretical framework for the study. Features of urban resource flows are then discussed in order to highlight opportunities for `resource integration'. Having established the context of the study, a precise `research question' is formulated to guide the rest of the research.

Who is this useful for: urban planners etc.

\subsection{Urban trends}
Three things can be said about urbanisation globally: (1) it is on the \emph{increase}; (2) this fact is \emph{important}; and (3) it follows from (1) and (2) that urbanisation is \emph{innevitable}. Firstly, the \emph{increase} in the global urban population is considered.

Currently, urban areas are home to about half of the global population \citep{AREAS2012}\footnote{Note: statistics in this report will generally be from 2011 or earlier. More recent figures will not be recorded because they will need to be updated for the final submission anyway.}. By 2030, it is expected that the urban population will rise to 61\% of the total, and again to 70\% by 2050, as cities absorb population growth, and continue to receive migrants from rural areas, aand rural areas become reclassified as urban \citep{Cohen2006}. Two notable features of this urbanisation are that firstly, most of the growth is concentrated in the developing world, with Africa and Asia together accounting for 86\% of the increase in urban dwellers by 2050 \citep{York2011}; and that despite there being much attention on `megacities', the majority of urban growth will be in smaller cities (below 500000 people) in the forseable future). Cities of more than 10 million residents will accomodate less than 10\% of the urban population \citep{Cohen2006}.

These forecasts aren't just the view of a small number, but widely accepted opinion. Thus even \citet{Cohen2004} who takes a skeptical look at urbanisation forecasts (pointing out that historical forecasts can be overestimates by more than 75\%; and that there is no universally consistent definition of `urban'\footnote{See for example \citet{DepartmentforCommunitiesandLocalGovernment2006}.} concludes: \emph{``Neverthelss, despite all the problems of error and inaccuracy and the long-standing definitional problems that have never been overcome, it is clear that the world is still in the midst of a sweeping and profound urban transformation that is literally changing the face of the planet.''}

It is natural to ask why such trends in urbanisation are seen, and whether this is good or bad. A useful description of the mechanism of urbanisation has been given by \citet{WorldBank2008a}. Urban centres arise as people migrate from the countryside for employment and better access to services (such as education, healthcare and employment). As cities grow, they beging to specialise with firms taking advantages of economies of scale. Cities become `agglomeration economies' when multiple types of firms and industries occupy the space, facilitating knowledge spillovers, and serving each other, such that individual firms can do their job better. At the same time, transport (and hence trade) costs reduce. Thus scale economies and agglomeration economies act to increase trade, and hence the prosperity of an area, attracting more migrants to the area. Thus a virtuous circle arises whereby city size and economic growth feed each other. This principle is seen in practise, given that one source estimates that 80\% of global GDP is generated in urban areas \citep{AREAS2012}.

This isn't to say that cities are without problems: the widespread presence of slums being one obvious concern (the World Bank describes these as `growing pains', and notes that they were historically seen in cities like London, but are no longer in existence there). However, in general, urbanisation is a clear route to economic prosperity. It is good news that the urbanisation patterns seen historically in OEDC countries are being replicated in the developing world \citep{WorldBank2008a}. This leads to the conclusion that urbanisation in \emph{important}.

Finally then, it must be the case that urbanisation is \emph{innevitable} due to the economic prosperity it brings to the developing world. Thus it is troubling to learn that \emph{``\ldots 72\% of developing countries have adopted policies designed to stem the tide of migration to their cities.''} GUARDIAN REFERENCE.

\subsection{Challenges posed by urban areas}
Having considered urbanisation trends and their benefits, the challenges of urbanisation are now considered. There are two primary challenges---those of \emph{environmental strain} and \emph{economic sustainability}.

IEA 71\% energy related emissions.

\citep{Bettencourt2007} Innovation cycles
\citep{Agudelo-Vera2011} global impacts of resourec problems.

\citep{Batt2010} to summarise.



However, as well as presenting these challenges, there are also unique opportunities inherent to urban spaces which can be exploited.

\subsection{Opportunities afforded by urban areas}
The density of urban areas, and the resulting co-location of infrastructures is the source of a potential solution to the challenges posed by urban areas.

An underlying theoretical framework is required which can help us measure the scale of the challenges presented; the opportunities on offer; and the success of the models. The 'urban metabolism' concept will serve this purpose.

Many studies suggest integrating infrastructures within their own field. This project is just an extension of that concept.

The definition of integration (literature may be different from this study).

Furthermore, there is little research in this field (despite many calls for it).  

\subsection{Urban metabolism---the theoretical framework}
Urban metabolism is the theoretical concept which supports this study in three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Urban metabolism studies give data which motivates the development of the models.
	\item It suggests am objective to achieve in the model: namely, a move away from resource `linearisation' towards `circularisation'.
	\item It provides a way of measuring the success of the models.
\end{enumerate}
Can be used to quantify the `challenges' discussed in that section.

\subsection{Aims and scope of the study}
Having now outlined the context and motivation for the study, a `research question' is posed. This gives the study a clear focus, and provides a way of testing the success of the final outcome of the study.

\subsection{Report structure}
Having presented the background to the study to provide motivation for the research question posed, the report continues by reviewing existing methods of optimising the provision of energy, water and waste in Section~\ref{sec:methods}. In Section~\ref{sec:models}, prototype models at their initial stage are presented. The report conludes in Section~\ref{sec:conc} with preliminary results, and an outline of the work to be undertaken in the rest of the project.

In summary, it has been argued cities need to focus on resource integration in order to reduce damage to the environment and economic risk. Currently, there are no models which consider the optimal management of multiple urban resources.

\subsection{Summary}
In conclusion, there is strong case to be made that research into a model that optimises the provision of urban energy, water and waste resources should be persued. This is because urbanisation has socioeconomic advantages, such that it should not be resisted, despite the challenges it brings. Rather, urban centres provide an opportunity with the proximity and co-location of infrastructure to meet the challenges of resource management. On top of this there is a research-gap in the field of integrated resource provision.
