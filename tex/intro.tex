The final outcome of this study will be tools which can be used to optimise the provision of water, waste and energy resources within an urban area, at a minimal financial and economic cost, subject to various constraints. Before the methodology and models are described, the context of urban areas is examined in order to motivate the development of such models. Firstly, the urban trends observed around the world are examined before outlining the challenges and opportunities associated with urban areas. The concept of `urban metabolism' is introduced, which will provide the underlying theoretical framework for the study. Features and trends of urban resource flows are then discussed in order to highlight opportunities for `resource integration'. Having established the context of the reseach, a precise `research question' is formulated to guide the rest of the research.

\subsection{Urban trends}
Three things can be said about urbanisation globally: (1) it is on the \emph{increase}; (2) this fact is \emph{important}; and (3) it follows from (1) and (2) that urbanisation is \emph{innevitable}.

Whilst urban areas serve a vital role to society, they are not without their challenges. These are now considered.

\subsection{Challenges posed by urban areas}
There are two primary challenges posed by urban areas---those of \emph{environmental strain} and \emph{economic sustainability}.

It isn't all bad news however, because urban areas also provide the opportunities for a solution.

\subsection{Opportunities afforded by urban areas}
The density of urban areas, and the resulting co-location of infrastructures is the source of a potential solution to the challenges posed by urban areas.

An underlying theoretical framework is required which can help us measure the scale of the challenges presented; the opportunities on offer; and the success of the models. The 'urban metabolism' concept will serve this purpose.

\subsection{Urban resources---flows, interactions and intersections}

\subsection{Aims and scope of the study}
Having now outlined the context and motivation for the study, a `research question' is posed. This gives the study a clear focus, and provides a way of testing the success of the final outcome of the study.

\subsection{Report structure}
Having presented the background to the study to provide motivation for the research question posed, the report continues by reviewing existing methods of optimising the provision of energy, water and waste in Section~\ref{sec:methods}. In Section~\ref{sec:models}, prototype models at their initial stage are presented. The report conludes in Section~\ref{sec:conc} with preliminary results, and an outline of the work to be undertaken in the rest of the project.
